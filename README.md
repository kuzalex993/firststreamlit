## California housing. Price prediction
This is regression task for price prediction using as inputs some information about dictricts where the houses are placed.
This project have two part:
- Exploration data analysis. This part is presented as a dashboard by using **Streamlit tool**. The results of EDA you can find by the link: https://kuzalex993-california-housing.streamlit.app/ <br>
Or you can use streamlit_app.py file to deploy the report by yuorself in **Streamlit Cloud**.
- Modeling part you can find in *California_housing.ipynb*. There are several trained models. This modleing was done without advanced preprocessing, only scaling of the feature vectores.
- The next step is to apply pre-processing (outlier processing, data collection problem, multicollinearity solution) to increase the generalizing ability of the algorithms.
